Here are all the helpful resources that I have looked through to make this project possible. Brief summaries of the resource are included.




# Basics

* [THE BASICS OF PROTEIN STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION](http://www.interactive-biology.com/6711/the-basics-of-protein-structure-and-function/)
    * This site contains a brief description of the very basics of proteins. It talks about protein functions, structures, and stability.





# Research Papers 

* 1989, [Protein secondary structure prediction with a neural network](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC286422/). 





# Data

* [Protein Structure Prediction Center](http://predictioncenter.org/)
    * initiates the CASP experiments to challenge researchers to predict protein structures.
    * contains data on proteins. Contains PDB files.
