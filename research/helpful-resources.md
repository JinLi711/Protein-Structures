Here are all the helpful resources that I have looked through to make this project possible. Brief summaries of the resource are included.









# Data

* [Protein Structure Prediction Center](http://predictioncenter.org/)
    * initiates the CASP experiments to challenge researchers to predict protein structures.
    * contains data on proteins. Contains PDB files.

* [CAMEO](https://www.cameo3d.org/)
    * a place for evaluating the accuracy of protein predictions






# Wiki Pages

* [Protein secondary structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_secondary_structure)

* [Multiple sequence alignment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_sequence_alignment)

* [CASP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CASP)




# Programs

* [CNS Solve](http://cns-online.org/v1.3/)
    * used to determine macromolecular structure

* [RaptorX](http://raptorx.uchicago.edu/)
    * predict protein structures and functions

* [VMD](https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/)
    * for visualizing molecules

* [CMView](http://www.bioinformatics.org/cmview/manual.html)
    * for visualizing and analyzing network of contacts between residues
