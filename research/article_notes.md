Notes on the articles that I've read.

# THE BASICS OF PROTEIN STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION

* This site contains a brief description of the very basics of proteins. It talks about protein functions, structures, and stability.


# AlphaFold @ CASP13: “What just happened?”

* NEED TO GET BACK TO THIS SINCE

* AlphaFold: co-evolutionary based method: extract evolutionary couplings from protein MSA. Predict whether two amino acids are in contact or not using MSAs. Feed it through an algorithm to predict 3D structure.
* AlphaFold used a softmax over discretized spatial ranges as outputs, predicting probability distribution over distances
* Insights from AlphaFold: don't just predict contact maps but also distances
