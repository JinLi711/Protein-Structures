Here are all the helpful resources that I have looked through to make this project possible. Brief summaries of the resource are included.









# Data

* [Protein Structure Prediction Center](http://predictioncenter.org/)
    * initiates the CASP experiments to challenge researchers to predict protein structures.
    * contains data on proteins. Contains PDB files.

* [CAMEO](https://www.cameo3d.org/)
    * a place for evaluating the accuracy of protein predictions

* [Dunbrack Lab](http://dunbrack.fccc.edu/PISCES.php)
    * great for getting a list of PDB IDs with certain conditions (like within a resolution cutoff)

* [RCSB](https://www.rcsb.org/#Subcategory-download_structures)
    * for downloading PDB files





# Wiki Pages

* [Protein secondary structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_secondary_structure)

* [Multiple sequence alignment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_sequence_alignment)

* [CASP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CASP)





# Biology Web Servers For Predictions

* [RaptorX](http://raptorx.uchicago.edu/)
    * predict protein structures and functions

* [JPred 4](http://www.compbio.dundee.ac.uk/jpred/)
    * predicts secondary structure from PDB sequence

* [CONFOLD](http://protein.rnet.missouri.edu/confold/)
    * predict protein coordinates with contact map, amino acid sequence, and secondary structure

# Programs

* [CNS Solve](http://cns-online.org/v1.3/)
    * used to determine macromolecular structure

* [VMD](https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/)
    * for visualizing molecules

* [CMView](http://www.bioinformatics.org/cmview/manual.html)
    * for visualizing and analyzing network of contacts between residues

* [DSSP](https://swift.cmbi.umcn.nl/gv/dssp/)
    * Finds secondary structure of existing PDB files
    * does not do any prediction

* [PyMol](https://pymol.org/2/)
    * for visualizing molecules 

* [Modeller](https://salilab.org/modeller/)
    * for visualizing molecules
