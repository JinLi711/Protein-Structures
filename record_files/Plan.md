|C         | 3/17/2019     | Parse through the culled files from Dunbrack's server to get only the PDB IDs seperated by commas.
|C         | 3/22/2019     | Move PDB files that we do not want to another folder.
|C         | 3/22/2019     | Extract only the FASTA sequence that I need.
|C         | 3/22/2019     | Align the PDB file sequence with FASTA sequence.
|C         | 3/22/2019     | Calculate contact map from PDB file and store it as a numpy array. (Need to deal with missing residues)
